### What is EPS?
Earning per share (EPS) is a measure or metric which calculate how much a company makes for every share of stock that it issues.
We use EPS to estimate the value of a given company or stock.
### EPS Formula
EPS = Net Profit - Preferred Dividends / End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding
### Diluted EPS
Because company can issue more share in future. Diluted EPS usually less than reguar EPS.
### How EPS help us?
higher EPS indicates the company is making more money.
### What is P/E?
Price-to-earning ration. Investor use it to assess the **potential** value of a stock. If P/E is high, stock may be overvalue. If P/E is low, stock is undervalue.\
In fundamental analysis, high P/E are sometimes called **growth stock**. (volatile and risky). Low P/E is value stock (slow growth).\
P/E Ration can't be used to assess the potential value of companies like high-tech, high-growth, start-up companies. We use earning yield instead. Earning yield = EPS/price * 100 (as percent).
### P/E formula
P/E = Share price / EPS
